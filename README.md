# Wildfire Analysis Using Sentinel-2 Imagery

This project demonstrates an analysis of wildfire using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The analysis is performed using the ArcGIS API for Python, leveraging geospatial data processing capabilities.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to demonstrate how satellite imagery data, specifically Sentinel-2 imagery, can be utilized for wildfire analysis. The analysis includes tasks such as detecting burned areas, assessing the extent of the wildfire, and understanding the impact on the surrounding environment.

## Techniques Used

- Utilization of the ArcGIS API for Python for geospatial data processing.
- Processing and analysis of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery.
- Detection of burned areas using image differencing techniques.
- Assessment of wildfire extent and severity.
- Visualization of results using interactive maps and spatial analysis tools.

## Getting Started

To run the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including the ArcGIS API for Python.
3. Open the provided Jupyter Notebook (`wildfire_analysis_using_sentinel-2_imagery.ipynb`) in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
4. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the analysis.
